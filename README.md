## Projects

### 1. Credit Risk and Default Prediction  
Used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to model time-to-default and assess credit risk using German loan data. Analyzed borrower features like credit history and phone ownership, and quantified repayment behavior through median survival times.

### 2. Forecasting Consumer Price Index Using Zillow's Rental Data  
Forecasted U.S. inflation trends using Zillow rent data and CPI, applying both ARIMA and VAR models. Compared univariate and multivariate approaches to evaluate whether rental prices improve CPI prediction accuracy.

### 3. Financial Portfolio Optimization  
Simulated optimal stock portfolios using historical data from Yahoo Finance. Evaluated risk-return tradeoffs through covariance, correlation, and volatility analysis, and visualized efficient frontiers to identify the most optimal asset allocations.
